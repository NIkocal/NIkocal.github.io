         <h3> Why is Pair Programming important to DBC ?</h3>
         <p>  Pairing is  important to DBC because it creates a collaborative learning environment where each student can actively bounce ideas off their partner and create solutions they wouldn't be able to do on their own. This also prepares students for future interactions when working in a team setting.
