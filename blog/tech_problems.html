             Recently some of the most largest tech companies and startups of all sizes relaeased their employment data. The results only confirmed what most people believed which is that women, blacks and hispanics are make up a small percentage of tech workforce. This is masde worse by the fact that in most cases when companies are hiring they will most likely unconsiously hire individuals who fit their background, to create a certain company culture where everyone is on the same page. This makes it more difficult for individuals of different ethnicities to break through the interview process. But acknowledging and defining a problem is th first step in finding a solution. Unlike in the past where there would be alot of speculation about how to increase diversity but no real efforts being made. It seems as if there is a real collective effort being made in all areas from getting more women and minorities interested in CS to how companies evaluate potential employees of different ethnicities. Even though I am still on my journey to become a developer and not yet employed. I hope that I can work in an environment where I'm accepted for who I am and treated just like everyone else.
