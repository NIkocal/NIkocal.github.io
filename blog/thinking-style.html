             In order to to identify our learning  and thinking styles each student is required to take the Gregorc Mind Styles Model. The four categories are Abstract Random, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random and finally Concrete Sequential.According to the test, i am an Abstract Randon thinker, which based on the description i feel is an accurate prediction . However i question the validity of this test because i dont believe you can pinpoint someones thinking style based on words they feel describe themselves. There were times when i took the test where i felt i chose an answer but i also related to another option as well. Also there are qualities in each that i think everyone exhibits and it's not exclusive just to your thinking style. For example they say a abstract random learner likes to focus on the issues at hand and establish friendly relationships but regardless of your thinking style i think most anyone does this. As it relates to my learning experience so far i definately need to work on my ability to break problems down into small pieces because even though i have a coneptual understanding of this i still feel like i bite off more than i can chew. Another issue i need to work on is my adherence to specific deadlines.

              Sometimes i get caught going down to many rabbit holes or i work on a problem far too long and i need to definately improve on that. I'll definately start being more disciplined when it comes to timeboxing on challenges to fix that problem. As it relates to my journey on becoming more growth minded, i definately still struggle with this deep fear of failure and a serious inferiority complex. Since I've started DBC, going through the more personal challenges have really forced me to face my fears and to understand i am a work in progess. Everyday i feel i am getting a little better at understanding myself and how i learn. This is all very new to me and I will improve myself as a developer and on an individual evel as well.
