      When i first discovered Dev Bootcamp I knew at a gut level that they cared strongly about molding you into a better person rather than just finding you a job and teaching you a skillset. Sure those things are what you pay for but it's obvious that  at an individual level, that they want you to grow into the best version of yourself by the end of the program, and to have a mindset that is grounded in learning in spite of difficulties and growth. I feel very excited to know that i will be around some great people and share such a wonderful experience in a culture that values love, empathy, communication, teamwork, education, and the list goes on.

      I really love the idea of taking your education into your own hands and having the hacker mindset, so this type of culture resonates with me. 
      I think my expectations are the same and i can't wait to begin. This will probably be my most nerve racking experience of my life but i'm also super excited because i'll be doing what i'm passionate about. I definately suffer from a lot of fears that Shareef spoke of but i won't let fear hold me back from this experience.
