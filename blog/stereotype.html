          <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
            <p> 
             Stereotype threat is the fear of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype of whatever group and social categories you indentity with. For example a white male may be the most well meaning and racially fair person, and socialises with a diverse group of people. However, he would probably feel the most uncomfortable broaching any racial topics for fear of being seen as racist.

             I grew up in the West Indies and my worldview is firmly anchored in that culture, I now fully identify with and accept my heritage but it wasn't always like that. When I was younger I used to reject my own culture because whenever I interacted with people born in America, and my heritage came up there wass a disconnect. This is because my personality doesn't fit  with the false representation of what a Jamaican is supposed to be like. 
             </p>
             <p>
             That said, I can't speak for all West Indian people but I never really thought about race until living in America. I read and understood it on an intellectual level but i never experienced the emotional and psycological aspects of it.As such it was a real culture shock when I learned what it mean't to be black in America.

             I'll never forget my first experience of stereotype threat when I went to a meetup event and i was the black guy in the room. It was my second meetup event which was a ruby talk with a few presentations and stuff. I don't know why i had this irritating feeling that i didn't belong or that i stuck out like a sore thumb. This is not to say that anyone else did anything at all to make me feel that way but i never felt so isolated in room full of people. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Just understanding what it is and talking to people about it has really helped me in dealing with and I would encourage anyone else to do the same, possibly with a mentor who you can give you some positive feedback. Whenever I may be asked to give feedback i will make sure to be specific with my criticism but also encouraging, also adding possible solutions. I think DBC has created an environment that actively promotes empathy and understanding where everyone is treated in a way that makes them feel like they belong and can be themself.
