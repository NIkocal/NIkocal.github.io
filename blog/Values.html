          <h1 >Values</h1>
            <p> These are the values in my life that i try to live up to: Self-Improvement,Pragmatism
              Resilience
              Challenge
              Persistence
              Introspection
            Understanding
              Teamwork
          <p>
          <p>Persistence by definition means to continue in spite of difficulty or obstacles. Throughout my life, as short as it may be, alot of what other people thought was natural talent in different areas of my life was actually years of hard work. Persistence is important to me because it means constantly trying to improve and to never give up. </p>
          <p>
            The last time someone reached out to me for advice it was about making the right decisions in terms of their education.
            I was happy to solicit my perspective on the issue because i really value improving yourself intellectually and gaining more understanding. As long as your are learning something new that will enhance your knowledge on a given topic.
          </p>
<p>
  When i think about my values they definately give me a sense of direction and allow me to overcome certain negative emotions i feel from time to time. I also believe being mindful of your values can be a light in the darkness if you feel like you are being threatened by a stereotype. Thinking about your values will help you in those difficult times and allow you to see the bigger picture.
