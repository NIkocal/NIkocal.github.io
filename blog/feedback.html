          <p>Pair Programming and Feedback</p>
          <p>
            An important aspect of the DBC learning philosophy is that all students are required to  collaborate on challenges through pair programming. This is where one person is the driver, as the name implies they are responsible for typing in code and is in control of the keyboard while the other pair, gives instructions and makes decisions of the structure of the code. At first I was partly excited because it would be a new experience for me and also scared that i would not be on par with some of the students. But so far it really has been a positive experience which has really pushed me out of my comfort zone and improved my skills. Thus far i've had mostly good experiences while pairing, at times depending on my pair's personality it can be a little awkward and quiet while for others, we tend to approach problems differently but ultimately end up learning about the various ways to solve challenges. I also enjoyed working with my fellow cohort because even though sometimes there was obviously times where I didn't understand something and they did, they always took that opportunity to explain and pass on some knowledge,

          After pairing we are required to give feedback about our pair and they do the same. I try to make sure that when I am giving feedback it is something that is constructive and that is more about the challenge we collaborated on,instead of the person . But I sometimes struggle with this aspect because I feel like I'm not good enough to tell someone how to improve. In terms of the feedback i recieve it has been postive thus far and I am doing my best to use the feedback improve and become a better developer.
